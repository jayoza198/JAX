# JAX

What is JAX?
JAX is an open-source numerical computing library developed by Google. It is built on top of the NumPy library and provides high-performance computing on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. JAX aims to combine the ease-of-use and expressiveness of NumPy with the ability to perform efficient automatic differentiation and take advantage of hardware accelerators.

Key Concepts in JAX:

    NumPy-like API: JAX's API is designed to be similar to NumPy, so if you're familiar with NumPy, you'll find it easy to work with JAX. JAX's jax.numpy module provides functions and data types that are compatible with NumPy.

    Functional Programming: JAX promotes a functional programming style, where you define computations as pure functions. This style enables automatic differentiation and allows JAX to efficiently track gradients through your code.

    Automatic Differentiation: JAX provides automatic differentiation capabilities, allowing you to compute derivatives of functions with respect to their inputs. The jax.grad function is commonly used to compute gradients, and it returns a function that computes the gradient for a given input.

    JIT Compilation: JAX leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation to optimize computations. The jax.jit decorator can be used to compile a function for efficient execution. JIT compilation eliminates unnecessary overhead and can significantly speed up your code.

    GPU/TPU Acceleration: JAX seamlessly supports running computations on GPUs and TPUs, enabling you to take advantage of hardware accelerators for faster execution. JAX automatically handles memory transfers and device synchronization.

    Transformations: JAX provides transformation functions such as jax.vmap and jax.pmap for vectorizing or parallelizing computations. These functions allow you to apply functions to arrays or collections of arrays efficiently.

Getting Started:
To get started with JAX, you need to install the library by running ```pip install jax``` 

JAX has a few dependencies, such as NumPy and a compatible version of the XLA compiler (which is automatically installed with JAX).
